Vibe Care is a healthy habits tracker where keeping up with your goals allows you to collect virtual pets that support you in living a better lifestyle.

The project was developed by Brandon Ye, Barrett Arbour, Jessica Li, and Terry Luan during QHacks 2020, a 36 hour hackathon at Queen's University. It was built with Processing and written in Java, featuring original art assets and a gamification system that awards uers with virtual currency and in-game rewards to incentivize their healthy habits.
